# 👋 Hi, I’m Wiktor  

Aspiring **backend engineer** from Poland, currently building a foundation in **Go (Golang)** while learning to think in systems. I value **clarity, consistency, and long-term growth** over shortcuts or surface-level progress.  

I’m the type who’d rather understand how something *works* before copying it — I break things down, rebuild them, and document the process. My endgame is to create scalable, reliable systems that make sense under the hood.  

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working On
- **Go Projects**: small but deep — calculators, word counters, and other CLI tools where every line has to earn its keep.  
- **Git Discipline**: versioned milestones, clean commits, and project documentation that shows *how* things evolved.  
- **Systems Thinking**: training myself to reason about data flow, architecture, and code clarity before writing a single line.  

---

## 🎯 Goals for 2025
- Build production-level backend APIs in Go  
- Learn system design fundamentals and concurrency  
- Contribute to open-source Go projects  
- Land my first backend engineering role

## 💡 What Drives Me
I like things that **make sense** — logic, structure, process. Backend development gives me that sense of control: predictable systems built from unpredictable problems. I don’t chase tutorials; I chase understanding.  

Consistency isn’t something I talk about — it’s what I fight for every week while balancing work and school. Every line of Go I write is a step closer to turning this into a career I own.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
> “Write less code, think more.”  

I believe in problem-solving through deep understanding, not guesswork.  
No copy-paste, no shortcuts.  
Each project I build teaches one new concept — not everything at once.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (In Progress)
- **Languages**: Go, a bit of Python  
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Linux, VS Code  
- **Concepts**: APIs, error handling, data structures, state management

## ⚙️ Current Project: WoopCalc
A command-line calculator built in Go.  

Features:
- Continuous calculations  
- History tracking  
- Modular package structure  
- Clean error handling  

**Practicing:**
- Packages and modularity  
- Input validation  
- Slice and array behavior  
- Iterative problem-solving  

---

## 🧩 Background
I currently work as a **waiter**, balancing shifts with self-taught backend development and school every other week. The pace is slow but deliberate — because I’m building something that lasts.  

Transitioning into tech isn’t a hobby; it’s a structured plan. Every bug I fix and every project I refine is a brick in that plan.
