# 👋 Hi, My name is Wiktor 

Aspiring backend developer from Poland, currently diving deep into Golang and working my way into the tech industry. I'm all about consistency, discipline, and long-term goals.

_Currently I'm working as a waiter while juggling weekly school with it, progress has been slow but transferring into a tech career and working within systems and backends has always been my dream_

## 🎯 Goals (2025)

- ✅ Learn Golang fundamentals (syntax, tools, testing)
- 🚧 Build small backend projects (APIs, CLI tools)
- 🧱 Contribute to open-source once I'm confident
- 🧾 Document my journey publicly to stay accountable
- ☆ Get hired for at least one freelance work
